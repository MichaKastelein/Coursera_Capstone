Problem:
I would like to open an Italian restaurant in Miami. I want to know what the best borough is to locate.

Data:
The data I will be using will be coming from the Foursquare API. I will use the API to get information of the boroughs that have the Italian restaurants as one of their most common venues. I will also be using the Wikipedia page of the Boroughs of Miami and their latitude and longitude information.
